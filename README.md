CiviCRM WordPress Profile Sync keeps a WordPress and BuddyPress user profile in sync with a CiviCRM contact.

### Description

Please note: this is the development repository for *CiviCRM WordPress Profile Sync*. It can be found in [the WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/civicrm-wp-profile-sync/), which is the best place to get it from if you're not a developer.

The *CiviCRM WordPress Profile Sync* plugin keeps the "First Name", "Last Name", "Email Address" and "Website" fields of a *WordPress* (and *BuddyPress*) user profile in sync with the corresponding fields of a *CiviCRM* contact. The synchronisation takes place regardless of whether the changes are made in *WordPress*, *BuddyPress* or *CiviCRM*.

This plugin recommends a minimum of *WordPress 4.9* and *CiviCRM 5.23*. If you want to maintain sync with BuddyPress user profiles, then it also requires *BuddyPress 3.0* and the [BP XProfile WordPress User Sync](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-xprofile-wp-user-sync/) plugin to do so.

### Installation

There are two ways to install from GitHub:

#### ZIP Download

If you have downloaded *CiviCRM WordPress Profile Sync* as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository, do the following to install and activate the plugin:

1. Unzip the .zip file and, if needed, rename the enclosing folder so that the plugin's files are located directly inside `/wp-content/plugins/civicrm-wp-profile-sync`
2. Activate the plugin
3. You are done!

#### git clone

If you have cloned the code from GitHub, it is assumed that you know what you're doing.

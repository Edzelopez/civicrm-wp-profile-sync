CiviCRM WordPress Profile Sync
==============================

Please note: this is the development repository for *CiviCRM WordPress Profile Sync*. It can be found in [the WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/civicrm-wp-profile-sync/), which is the best place to get it from if you're not a developer.

The *CiviCRM WordPress Profile Sync* plugin keeps the "First Name", "Last Name", "Email Address" and "Website" fields of a *WordPress* (and *BuddyPress*) user profile in sync with the corresponding fields of a *CiviCRM* contact. The synchronisation takes place regardless of whether the changes are made in *WordPress*, *BuddyPress* or *CiviCRM*.

#### Notes ####

This plugin requires a minimum of *WordPress 3.9* and *CiviCRM 4.6*. If you want to maintain sync with BuddyPress user profiles, then it also requires *BuddyPress 1.8* and the [BP XProfile WordPress User Sync](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-xprofile-wp-user-sync/) plugin to do so.

#### Installation ####
